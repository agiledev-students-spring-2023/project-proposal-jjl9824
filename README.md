# Project Proposal

Write a proposal for a software product you would like to pursue for the majority of the semester. Make it obvious, interesting, and make the need for it sound convincing.

### Project title

LibDoor

### What and why?

LibDoor is a library delivery app, where it aims to bring books from your local public library to your doorstep. Not everyone has the ability to go and use the resources that their local public library provides. This app aims to make receiving books much more accessible, saving time and resources. If the user doesn't want to utilize the delivery option, they can do pickup instead. The app will show available and unavailable books. The app will feature a tag system, so that users can search through their preferred genres/authors. There will also be a review system so that users will have better understanding on whether or not they want to pick a book. The tag and review system aim for better personalization and experience for the users, who otherwise would need to return the books if it wasn't to their liking. 

### For whom?

LibDoor is aimed for anyone who does not have the accessiblity to go to their local library to read books. This can include disabled people who are stuck at home/hospitals, or people who don't have time to go to the library but still want to enjoy a good book or two. 

### How?

* Have a sign-in feature that links you to your library card.
* Show the library catalogue through a database.
* Tag/filter system (ie genres/authors/availibility).
* Review system of each book (possibility on only letting users review if book has been previously checked out)

### Scope

A brief justification that the proposal is neither too easy nor too ambitions for a group of approximately 4 - 6 programmers to undertake in one semester.

The front-end development using ReactJS shouldn't take too much time, as it should be kept simple and show the catalogue, profile, and reviews. The database of the catalogue and the filter system shouldn't be that complicated to work with. The review system might get a little complicated to do with each book, but shouldn't be impossible. There can always be more features added, like an API to get current location to find the nearest public library.
